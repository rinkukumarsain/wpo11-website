          Rs. 5/- as Inviter Bonus upon the successful completion of such contest or contest, provided that the Inviter
          has successfully completed the requisite steps detailed in a) above that make him/her eligible to receive such

          any of the verification steps within the Verification Period or omits to provide documents requested for such
          verification, the Inviter shall not be eligible to earn the applicable Inviter Bonus.</div>
        <div>d) It is clarified that the Inviter will be eligible to receive the Inviter Bonus with respect to any
          contests or contests only in the event the winners are declared for such contests or contests only. In the
          event that the contest entry amount paid by the Invitee is refunded to the Invitee with respect to any cash
          contest or contest, for any reason, the Inviter shall not be eligible to receive any Inviter Bonus for such
          contest or contest.</div>
        <div>The Bonus Amounts credited to the Inviter/Invitee can be used by the Inviter/Invitee to join cash contests
          and contests offered by <span class="">WPO11</span> through the Platform. No part of the
          Bonus Amount may be used to join private contests or be withdrawn or transferred to any other cash balance
          account held by the Inviter/Invitee with <span class="">WPO11</span> or to any third party
          account or to any bank/payment instrument account. THE BONUS AMOUNT HAS NO EXPIRY.</div>
        <div>The deposit of the Bonus Amount shall be at the sole discretion of <span class="">WPO11</span> and shall be
          subject to the Inviter’s/Invitee’s compliance with
          these Terms. <span class="">WPO11</span> may substitute or change the Bonus Amount offered
          under the Program at any time without notice. An Inviter/Invitee may not substitute the amount of Bonus Amount
          or substitute offering for other items or exchange for cash.</div>
        <div><span class="">WPO11</span> reserves the right to: withhold the deposit of the Bonus
          Amount; and/or forfeit any deposited Bonus Amount to an Inviter/Invitee or any prizes/winnings earned by the
          participant by using such Bonus Amount; and/or deactivate the accounts of the Inviter/Invitee, in the event
          that it determines or reasonably believes that such Inviter/Invitee has violated these Terms or the terms and
          conditions of the <span class="">WPO11</span> fantasy contest. Mere participation in the
          Program does not entitle the Inviter/Invitee to receive any Bonus Amount.</div>
        <div><span class="">WPO11</span> may, at its sole and absolute discretion, disqualify any
          Inviter/Invitee if such Inviter/Invitee engages in or it is found that such Inviter/Invitee has engaged in any
          illegal, unlawful or improper conduct (with regard to the Program or otherwise). The decision of <span
            class="">WPO11</span> will be final and binding with regard to the Program, and the
          deposit of the Bonus Amount and no correspondence, objection, complaints, etc. will be entertained in this
          regard.</div>
        <div>
          This Program cannot be clubbed with any other contests/promotions/programs that are running simultaneously and
          organized or conducted by <span class="">WPO11</span>.</div>
        <div><span class="">WPO11</span> reserves the right to change/modify/or withdraw the Program
          and/or change these terms and conditions without any prior notice of the same at its sole discretion. The

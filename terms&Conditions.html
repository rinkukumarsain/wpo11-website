For the purposes of these Terms, an 'existing user of <span class="font-bold text-black">WPO11</span>' shall mean a user who presently operates an account with the Platform or operated an account with the Platform at any point of time.</div>
                          <div>An Invitee who is an existing user of <span class="font-bold text-black">WPO11</span> is not permitted to register a new account with the Platform for the purpose of availing of the Bonus Amount. <span class="font-bold text-black">WPO11</span> will determine in its sole discretion whether an Invitee is an existing user of <span class="font-bold text-black">WPO11</span> or not and take appropriate action.</div>
                          <div>The verification process may require an Inviter/Invitee to submit personal information about the user (Inviter/Invitee) and documents identifying the Inviter/Invitee. The Inviter agrees to receive communication from <span class="font-bold text-black">WPO11</span> and to allow <span class="font-bold text-black">WPO11</span> to communicate with Invitees referred by you about the Inviter's participation in the Program. Any information collected in respect of the Inviter/Invitee as part of the Program or otherwise in the course of such person's use of the Website shall be subject to <span class="font-bold text-black">WPO11</span>'s Privacy Policy (available here: https://fantasycricket.<span class="font-bold text-black">WPO11</span>.com/in/privacypolicy for Indian users)</div>
                          <div>The verification of an Inviter/Invitee shall be completed at the time of first withdrawal by the Inviter/Invitee from the Inviter’s/Invitee's 'Your Winnings' account or 'Your Deposits' account with the Platform. An Inviter/Invitee may voluntarily seek verification of the Inviter/Invitee by clicking on the 'Verify Now' tab of the Account Balance page of the Inviter/Invitee's account with the Platform. In the event that the Invitee opts to register for a <span class="font-bold text-black">WPO11</span> account through the <span class="font-bold text-black">WPO11</span> Application, the Invitee can verify his/her contact information at the time of registration.</div>
                          <div>The Invitee will be eligible to earn a Bonus of Rs.51 (“Invitee Bonus”) upon a) successful verification of the Invitee’s mobile number. b) Provided that the Invitee completes the step mentioned in a) above within the Verification Period, the applicable Invitee Bonus shall be credited to the Invitee's Cash Bonus Account with the Platform, within fifteen (15) days of completion of successful verification of the Invitee’s mobile number. In the event that the Invitee fails to verify the Invitee's mobile number within the Verification Period or omits to provide documents requested for such verification, the Invitee shall not receive the applicable Invitee Bonus specified above due to the Invitee for completing such verification process.</div>

                          <div class="text-sm md:text-xl font-bold text-theme2 pt-5">Inviter Bonus</div>
                          <div>a) In order for an Inviter to be eligible to earn the Bonus Amount due to him/her ("Inviter Bonus"), the Inviter must also download and install the <span class="font-bold text-black">WPO11</span> Application on his/her mobile device verify his/her mobile number and email address prior to the completion of the Verification Period.</div>
                          <div>b) The credit of the Inviter Bonus is contingent on the Invitee's participation in cash contests on the Platform. For every Rs. 1 spent by the Invitee to join cash contests on the Platform, the Inviter will be eligible to earn a bonus amount of Rs. 0.10 subject to a maximum of Rs. 50/-. As an example, in the event that the invitee uses Rs. 50 from his Cash Bonus Account or Unutilized Account to join a cash contest or contest through <span class="font-bold text-black">WPO11</span> Application, the Inviter shall be eligible to receive Rs. 5/- as Inviter Bonus upon the successful completion of such contest or contest, provided that the Inviter has successfully completed the requisite steps detailed in a) above that make him/her eligible to receive such amount.</div>
                          <div>c) Subject to the provisions of a) and b) above, the applicable Inviter Bonus earned by the Inviter shall be credited to the Inviter's Cash Bonus Account within fifteen (15) days of the completion of the cash contest or contest in which Invitee has used the Invitee Bonus or within fifteen (15) days of the Inviter completing the relevant step verification process, as the case may be. In the event that the Inviter fails to complete any of the verification steps within the Verification Period or omits to provide documents requested for such verification, the Inviter shall not be eligible to earn the applicable Inviter Bonus.</div>
                          <div>d) It is clarified that the Inviter will be eligible to receive the Inviter Bonus with respect to any contests or contests only in the event the winners are declared for such contests or contests only. In the event that the contest entry amount paid by the Invitee is refunded to the Invitee with respect to any cash contest or contest, for any reason, the Inviter shall not be eligible to receive any Inviter Bonus for such contest or contest.</div>
                          <div>The Bonus Amounts credited to the Inviter/Invitee can be used by the Inviter/Invitee to join cash contests and contests offered by <span class="font-bold text-black">WPO11</span> through the Platform. No part of the Bonus Amount may be used to join private contests or be withdrawn or transferred to any other cash balance account held by the Inviter/Invitee with <span class="font-bold text-black">WPO11</span> or to any third party account or to any bank/payment instrument account. THE BONUS AMOUNT HAS NO EXPIRY.</div>
                          <div>The deposit of the Bonus Amount shall be at the sole discretion of <span class="font-bold text-black">WPO11</span> and shall be subject to the Inviter’s/Invitee’s compliance with these Terms. <span class="font-bold text-black">WPO11</span> may substitute or change the Bonus Amount offered under the Program at any time without notice.
